# Atoms

**Atoms** are the basic building blocks of all matter. Each chemical element has distinct properties,
and they can’t be broken down further without losing their meaning.
(Yes, it’s true atoms are composed of even smaller bits like protons, electrons, and neutrons,but atoms are the smallest functional unit.)

If atoms are the basic building blocks of matter, then the **atoms of our interfaces serve as the foundational building blocks that comprise all our user interfaces**.
These atoms include [basic HTML elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element) like form labels,
inputs, buttons, and others that can’t be broken down any further without ceasing to be functional.

Each atom in the natural world has its own unique properties.
A hydrogen atom contains one electron, while a helium atom contains two.
These intrinsic chemical properties have profound effects on their application
(for example, the Hindenburg explosion was so catastrophic because the airship was filled with extremely flammable hydrogen gas versus inert helium gas).
In the same manner, each interface atom has its own unique properties, such as the dimensions of a hero image, or the font size of a primary heading.
These innate properties influence how each atom should be applied to the broader user interface system.

In the context of a pattern library, atoms demonstrate all your base styles at a glance,
which can be a helpful reference to keep coming back to as you develop and maintain your design system.
But like atoms in the natural world, interface atoms don’t exist in a vacuum and only really come to life with application.

## React

All atoms in placed in `src/ui/atoms`. <br/>
Each component should be simple as possible. <br/>
`src/ui/atoms/index.js` should be used to reexport each atom to `src/ui/index.js`.<br/>
Each component should have `.mdx` and `.test.js` files.

Example:

```js
// src/ui/atoms/button.js
import styled from "styled-components"

export const Button = styled.button`
  border: none;
  background-color: blue;
  color: white;
  border-radius: 5px;

  &:hover {
    background-color: red;
  }
`
```

> Don't forget to create `button.mdx` for documentation and `button.test.js` for tests.
