# Organisms

**Organisms** are assemblies of molecules functioning together as a unit.
These relatively complex structures can range from single-celled organisms all the way up to incredibly sophisticated organisms like human beings.

**Organisms are relatively complex UI components composed of groups of molecules and/or atoms and/or other organisms**.
These organisms form distinct sections of an interface.

Let’s revisit our search form molecule.
A search form can often be found in the header of many web experiences, so let’s put that search form molecule into the context of a header organism.

The header forms a standalone section of an interface,
even though it contains several smaller pieces of interface with their own unique properties and functionality.

Organisms can consist of similar or different molecule types.
A header organism might consist of dissimilar elements such as a logo image, primary navigation list, and search form.
We see these types of organisms on almost every website we visit.

While some organisms might consist of different types of molecules, other organisms might consist of the same molecule repeated over and over again.
For instance, visit a category page of almost any e-commerce website and you’ll see a listing of products displayed in some form of grid.

Building up from molecules to more elaborate organisms provides designers and developers with an important sense of context.
Organisms demonstrate those smaller, simpler components in action and serve as distinct patterns that can be used again and again.
The product grid organism can be employed anywhere a group of products needs to be displayed, from category listings to search results to related products.

Now that we have organisms defined in our design system, we can break our chemistry analogy and apply all these components to something that resembles a web page!
